        <br>
        <p>Most of us have grown up being taught the importance of education. But why is education<br>
            important? Through your frustrating school years, you may have thought that it was<br>
            a waste of time, or was just something that you needed to do in order to get a job. Truth be<br>
            told, however, education goes so much beyond just getting a job and making your parents<br>
            happy. In fact, itâ€™s one of the most powerful tools out there.</p>

                <img src="./images/uoPeople.jpeg" alt="uoPeople">
                <p>Education means studying in order to obtain a deeper knowledge and understanding of a<br>
                variety of subjects to be applied to daily life. Education is not limited to just knowledge<br>
                from books, but can also be obtained through practical experiences outside of the<br>
                classroom.</p>

                <h1>TOP 10 REASONS: WHY IS EDUCATIONN IMPORTANT?</h1>
                <p>There are many different understandings and definitions of what educationis, but one<br>
                thing can be universally agreed upon, which is the importance of education -- and here's<br>
                why.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>1. PROVIDES STABILITY</h1>
                <p>Education provides stability in life, and it's something that no one can ever take away from<br>
                you. By being well-educated and holding a college degree, you increase your chances for<br>
                better career opportunities and open up new doors for yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>2. PROVIDES FINANCIAL SECURITY</h1>
                <p>On top of stability, educaation also provides financial security, especially in today's society. A<br>
                good education tends to lead to a higher paying job, as well as  provide you with the skills<br>
                you with the skills needed to get there.</p>
                <p>Educated and well-informed individuals also know how to use money-saving tactics. They<br>
                are more likely to use coupon websites like <mark>EMUCoupon</mark> while shopping online to savve their<br>
                hard-earned money.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>3. NEEDED FOR EQUALITY</h1>
                <p>In order for the entire world to really become equal, it needs to start with education. If<br>
                everyone was provided with the same <mark>opportunities to education</mark>, then there would be less<br>
                gaps between social classes. Everyone would be able to have an equal chance at higher<br>
                paying jobs -- not just those that are already well-off.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>4. ALLOWS FOR SELF-DEPENDENCY</h1>
                <p>The importance of education is evident when it comes to being self-dependent. If we are<br>
                    educated, then it's something that belongs to us, and only us, allowing us to rely on no-one<br>
                    else other than ourselves. It can allow you to not only be financially independent, but also<br>
                    to make your own choices.</p>
                <h1>5. MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE</h1>
                <p>If you can dream it, you can achieve it. An education is the most powerful weapon you can<br>
                    possibly have, and with it, you can make all of your dreams come true. There are of course<br>
                    certain exceptions, depending on what you're aiming for, but generally an education will<br>
                take you as far as you're willing to go.</p>
                <br>
                <h1 id="No 6">6. A SAFER WORLD</h1>
                <p>Education is something that's not only neede on a personal level, but also on a global level,<br>
                    as it's something that keeps our world safe and makes it a more peaceful place. Education<br>
                tends to teach people the difference between right and wrong, and can help people stay out<br>
                of risky situations.</p>
